	      "\t$0",
	      "}"
	    ]
	  }
	}
  - $1, $2, ... - Tab stops (cursor positions)
  - $0 - Final cursor position
  - Typing foorloop will generate 3 lines. You will be asked at ${1} to edit the variable name i. Pressing Tab jumps to ${2}, i.e. to
    cariable count. Pressing another Tab will jump to ${0}
 - "isFileTemplate": false // snippet is intended to populate or replace a file's contents -> run the Snippets: Populate File from Snippet command in a new or existing file.
